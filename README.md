# InfraredThermometer
An infrared thermometer project for Arduino. Visit the project homepage for more information about the infrared sensor module, development blogs, and how this has been used in the field.

## Quick Start

This is still a work in progress, but currently shows the current temperature measurement, minimum , maximum, 20 sample rolling-average, and live scrolling line graph.

Visit my blog for more information, photos, and wiring diagrams.
