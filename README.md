# InfraredThermometer
An infrared thermometer project for Arduino. Visit the [project homepage](http://dariancabot.com/category/projects/infrared-thermometer/) for more information about the infrared sensor module, development blogs, and how this has been used in the field.

## Quick Start

This is still a work in progress, but currently shows the current temperature measurement, minimum , maximum, 20 sample rolling-average, and live scrolling line graph.

### Hardware requirements

This project is built with the follwing hardware:

* [Arduino Nano v3.0](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardNano)
* [Freetronics IRTemp](http://www.freetronics.com.au/products/irtemp-ir-temperature-sensor-module)
* [Adafruit Monochrome 128x64 OLED display](https://www.adafruit.com/products/326)

### Software requirements

You'll need to download and include the following libraries:

* [Adafruit_GFX.h](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library)
* [Adafruit_SSD1306.h](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_SSD1306)
